This repository contains exercises completed as part of PSYCH 205, the first semester data analysis course for psychology graduate students at UC Berkeley.

Exercises are assigned in R and were created by Prof. Frederic Theunissen (http://theunissen.berkeley.edu/). My goal is to eventually provide solutions in both R and Python, to act as a reference for both myself and others taking the course in the future.
