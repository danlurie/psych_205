This repository contains exercises completed as part of PSYCH 205, the first semester data analysis course for psychology graduate students at UC Berkeley.

Exercises are assigned in R and were created by [Prof. Frederic Theunissen](http://theunissen.berkeley.edu/).

My goal is to eventually provide solutions in both R and Python, to act as a reference for both myself and others taking the course in the future. This idea was inspired by [Michael Waskom](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/) and his [Psych216 repository](https://github.com/mwaskom/Psych216).

Each exercise, regardless of language, is housed in an [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). To view rendered versions of each notebook, please see the [PSYCH 205 page on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/danlurie/psych_205/tree/master/).
